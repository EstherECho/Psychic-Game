# Psychic-Game
Homework #3

This is a simple game that randomly picks a letter, and has the user guess which letter the computer chose.

The game contains the following fields:

Wins:           # of times the user has guessed the letter correctly.
Losses:         # of times the user has failed to guess the letter correctly after exhausting all guesses.
Guesses Left:   # of guesses left. This will update.
Guesses So Far: Displays letters user has typed, displayed until the user either wins or loses.

When the player wins an alert notifies the player that they have chosen the correct letter and that they have won. 
The Wins counter will increase by one and the game will start over again (without refreshing the page).

When the player loses an alert notifies the player that they have run out of guesses and that they have lost. 
The Losses counter will increase by one and the game will restart without a page refresh (just like when the user wins).

Enjoy!
